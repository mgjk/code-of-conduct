## Violating the Code of Conduct

When handling potential issues of harassment or unprofessionalism, please
remember our principles of education and being respectful: "We assume good
intentions and do our best to act in an empathetic fashion." and "we seek to
teach people how to improve themselves rather than to quickly exclude them for
their misunderstandings or mistakes."

Participants violating these rules may be asked to leave the event by
organizing members, or asked to no longer participate in any events by vote of
the executive committee.

This is not a zero tolerance policy. Zero tolerance places the burden of 
immediate judgement on the people involved, and ignores the important values 
of education and mutual respect in the community.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all venues and related social
events. The rules should not be seen as a burden, but as a point of pride of
the community.

As always, if you witness criminal behaviour, go to the police.
