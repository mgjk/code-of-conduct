## Professionalism

The community is a body comprised of professionals, academics and hobbyists. It
is expected that the community behave professionally at official events and
related functions (e.g, visiting a pub after a meeting).

Heckling of the speakers cannot be tolerated. Questions and comments to the
speaker should only be asked when the speaker has opened the floor to the
audience.

Plagiarism cannot be tolerated. When using other people's work in your
presentations or materials, appropriate references and citing of sources is
necessary.

Piracy cannot be tolerated. If you're unsure about the intellectual property
rights of a work, please talk with members of the community. Copyright and
intellectual property are areas of keen community interest.

Explicit sexual topics, sexual touching, or sexual imagery are not appropriate
for any event or related function. It is always off topic, it is not inclusive
or sensitive to all the different groups which may be present at events.

If an event will by its nature have sexual topics, touching or imagery, the
Linux community's name, GTALUG or TLUG should should not be included and
invitations should not be sent to the official public channels of the community.
