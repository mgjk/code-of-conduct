## Professionalism

The community is a body comprised of professionals, academics and hobbyists. It
is expected that the community behave professionally at official events and
related functions (e.g, visiting a pub after a meeting).

Heckling of the speakers cannot be tolerated. Questions and comments to the
speaker should only be asked when the speaker has opened the floor to the
audience.

Plagiarism cannot be tolerated. When using other people's work in your
presentations or materials, appropriate references and citing of sources is
necessary.

Piracy cannot be tolerated. If you're unsure about the intellectual property
rights of a work, please talk with members of the community. Copyright and
intellectual property are areas of keen community interest.

Explicit sexual topics, sexual touching, or sexual imagery are not appropriate
for any event or related function. It is always off topic, it is not inclusive
or sensitive to all the different groups which may be present at events.

If a third party event will knowingly encourage or participate in any of the 
above activities, the community's name, GTALUG or TLUG should not be included 
and invitations should not be sent using the official public channels.
