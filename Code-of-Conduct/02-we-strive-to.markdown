## We strive to:

### Educate

We strongly believe in education in all aspects of life. When in error
technically, professionally or personally, we seek to help people improve themselves
rather than to quickly exclude them for their misunderstandings or mistakes.

### Be respectful

We work together to resolve conflict. We assume good intentions and do our best
to act in an empathetic fashion. We don't allow frustration to turn into a
personal attack.

We respect personal space, dignity and all matters of our diverse makeup. We
strive for all members to feel comfortable.

We cannot accept those who are consistently intolerant, disrespectful, or
continually make others uncomfortable.

### Take responsibility for our words and our actions

We can all make mistakes; when we do, we take responsibility for them. If
someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully, and
work to right the wrong.

### Value clarity and consensus

Disagreements, social and technical, are normal, but we do not allow them to
persist and fester leaving others uncertain of the agreed direction.

We expect participants to resolve disagreements constructively. When they
cannot, we escalate the matter to structures with designated leaders to
arbitrate and provide clarity and direction.

### Ask for help when unsure

Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged,
though they may be directed to the appropriate individual or forum. Those who
are asked should be responsive and helpful.
